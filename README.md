# Exam-project-Library

This is my final Laravel project that I had to defend during the exam at Baltic Institute of Technology. And it was a success! I got the best grade 10/10. Here you can see a part of it:

Authors can be sorted by Name, Surname

There are error and success messages after each correction(add, edit, delete ect.)
